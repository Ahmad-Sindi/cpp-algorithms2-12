Algorithm Challenge #12 – Inverted Number Pattern
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer from the user and prints an inverted number pattern, where each line prints the current number as many times as its value.

This challenge helps build a solid understanding of nested loops, pattern printing techniques, and input handling in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How nested loops work

How to construct pattern-based output

Validating user input

Writing clean and modular code

Strengthening logic and algorithmic thinking

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Enter a positive number: 4

Output:

4444  

333  

22  

1  


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: inverted_number_pattern.cpp

Challenge Number: #12

💬 Notes
-
Pattern printing challenges are excellent for practicing loops and understanding program structure. They form a strong foundation for more complex logic-based problems.
